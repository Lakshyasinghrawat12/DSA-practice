## Input Parameters:

- **nums**: A list of integers.
- **k**: An integer representing the maximum allowed distance between two identical elements in the list.


## Dictionary Initialization (last_position):

- last_position is a dictionary that will store the last seen index of each number in nums.
Loop Through the List:

- The code iterates through each element in the list nums using the enumerate() function, which gives both the index (i) and the value (num) at that index.

## Check for Duplicate within Distance k:

- For each element num, the code checks if num has been seen before (i.e., if num is in last_position).
If it has been seen before, it calculates the difference between the current index i and the last seen index last_position[num].
If this difference is less than or equal to k, it means there are two indices i and j such that nums[i] == nums[j] and abs(i - j) <= k. In this case, the function returns True.
Update the Last Seen Position:

- If num has not been seen before, or if the condition isn't met, the current index i is stored in the dictionary last_position for the number num.

## Return False if No Pair is Found:

- If the loop finishes without finding any such pair, the function returns False.
