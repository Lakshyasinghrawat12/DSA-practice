# Sorting:
 
The code sorts the list first, which is an O(n log n) operation. Sorting isn't necessary for finding the missing number efficiently, and it adds extra computational complexity.

# Logic in the Loop: 

The loop iterates through each number in the sorted list and checks if the next number (i + 1) is present in the list. This doesn't directly solve the problem of finding the missing number.

# Return Statement: 

The return statement inside the loop will prematurely exit the function as soon as it finds the first i + 1 that's not in nums, which might not be the correct missing number.
