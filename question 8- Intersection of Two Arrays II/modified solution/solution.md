# Counting Frequencies:

- The first loop creates a dictionary count_dict where each key is an element from nums2, and its value is the count of how many times it appears in nums2.

# Finding the Intersection:

- The second loop iterates through nums1 and checks if the current element exists in count_dict with a count greater than 0. If it does, it appends the element to result and decrements the count in count_dict to ensure that each element is only counted as many times as it appears in both arrays.

# Efficiency:

- This approach is more efficient, with a time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the length of nums1 and m is the length of nums2.
