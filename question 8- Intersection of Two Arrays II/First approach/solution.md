# Iteration:

- You iterate through each element in nums1 and check if it exists in nums2.

# Adding to Result:

- If an element from nums1 exists in nums2, you append it to the result list and remove the first occurrence of that element from nums2 to ensure it is not counted again.

# Potential Issues:
**Efficiency:** The remove() function in Python has a time complexity of O(n) because it needs to search for the element to remove. Since you are doing this inside a loop that iterates over nums1, the overall time complexity of your solution can be O(n * m), where n is the length of nums1 and m is the length of nums2. This is less efficient compared to the dictionary-based solution we discussed earlier.

**In-place Modification:** Modifying nums2 in place (by using remove()) can lead to unintended side effects if nums2 is needed later in its original form. Itâ€™s often better to avoid modifying input lists directly unless explicitly required.
