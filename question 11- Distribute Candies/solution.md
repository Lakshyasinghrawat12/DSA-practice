# Length Calculation:

- length = len(candyType) calculates the total number of candies.

# Half Calculation:

- eat = length // 2 calculates the maximum number of candies that one person can eat (half of the total candies).

# Unique Candy Types:

- dis_candyType = set(candyType) creates a set of unique candy types.

# Return Value:

- If the number of unique candy types is greater than or equal to `eat`, it means the person can potentially `eat` all different types of candies (up to `eat` types), so it returns `eat`.

- If the number of unique candy types is less than `eat`, it means the person can only `eat` as many unique types of candies as there are, so it returns the number of unique candy types.
